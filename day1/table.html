    <p>Idli is a traditional South Indian dish made from fermented rice and lentil batter, steamed into soft, fluffy cakes. It's often served with coconut chutney and sambar, a spicy lentil soup.</p>
    <p>Idli and Vada are iconic breakfast staples and cherished elements of the famous food of Tamil Nadu. Idli, a soft, steamed rice cake, and Vada, a crispy, Savory lentil doughnut, are often enjoyed for their wholesome and delicious combination. Both dishes reflect the simplicity and flavour that define the cuisine of Tamil Nadu, offering a perfect balance of textures – the softness of the idli and the crunch of the vada. These dishes not only highlight the state's love for rice and lentils but also its mastery in creating healthy, flavourful meals that are enjoyed across India.
